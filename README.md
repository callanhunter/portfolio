# portfolio

### In this project, I coded out a portfolio using HTML and CSS. Some features of the portfolio include: when you hover over the projects, they enlarge, the navbar is linked to the sections, and the links will take you to the desired place. The color scheme is also inspired by a portfolio I saw on the internet and wanted to make my own version with that same color scheme. I also ran into some difficulties on the way. Some of the difficulties included: not formatting the CSS correctly so the page didnt exactly how I envisioned it and having some incorrect HTML syntax. These problems were resolved by trying out different methods and looking up different ways of approaching the problem. The biggest help was by trial and error. This project has taught me to stay humble and patient. Sometimes positioning elements with CSS can be a headache and this is one of those projects that help you get a better understanding of the CSS and HTML concepts.
